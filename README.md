# KitchenKeeper
 A kitchen organizer and recipe app
 Keep track of ingredients, build easy shopping lists, store recipes

## Use Needs
 I want to make Carbanara. I view the recipe and see 1) Ingridents 2) Tools 3) Directions 4) Pictures (op)). The app will compare the ingredents and tools to what I have in my kitchen and tell me what I have and don't have. If I don't have something I can add that to a shopping list.
 I want to go shopping. I can manually add items. Items I need for a recipe but I don't have I can add automatically. I can set up reminders to check an item and add it if I need to (i.e. Check milk). I can set up reocurring items to buy (i.e. apples, always buy apples).
 I want to plan my meals for the next week. I can queue up recipes to see what I have and what I need. I can add items I need to a shopping list.
